## I. Core Java Concepts

A strong foundation in Core Java is essential.

*   **Variables and Operators:** Be familiar with their usage.
*   **Control Flow Statements:** `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
*   **Strings:** Explain `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`, and their differences (immutability, thread-safety).
*   **Exception Handling:** Understand `try-catch-finally` blocks, `throw`, `throws`, checked vs. unchecked exceptions, and custom exceptions.
*   **Keywords:** Know the purpose and usage of `static`, `final`, `this`, `super`, `volatile`, etc.
*   **Garbage Collection:** Explain how it works and the Java Heap Space.
*   **Multithreading and Concurrency:**
    *   Understand `Thread` vs. `Runnable`.
    *   Concepts like `synchronization`, `deadlock`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`, and `wait()`.
    *   Basic understanding of `java.util.concurrent` package.
*   **Java 8 Features (and above):**
    *   **Lambda Expressions:** How they simplify code for functional interfaces.
    *   **Stream API:** Common operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `collect`.

## II. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This is a fundamental area for Java developers. Be prepared to explain and provide examples for each of the four pillars of OOP:

*   **Encapsulation:** Hiding data and methods within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access.
*   **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and showing only necessary functionalities (using abstract classes and interfaces).
    *   Difference between abstract class and interface.
*   **Inheritance:** Reusing code by allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another (`extends`, `implements`).
    *   Types of inheritance (single, multi-level, hierarchical).
    *   `Composition over Inheritance` principle.
*   **Polymorphism:** Allowing a single entity (method, operator) to take multiple forms.
    *   **Method Overloading:** Same method name, different parameters (compile-time polymorphism).
    *   **Method Overriding:** Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass (runtime polymorphism).
*   **Classes and Objects:** What they are, their relationship, and how to create them.
*   **Constructors:** Purpose, types, and constructor chaining.
*   **Access Modifiers:** `public`, `private`, `protected`, `default`.

## III. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

DSA questions are common, even for junior roles. Focus on basic concepts and common problems.

*   **Arrays:** Basic operations, advantages, and disadvantages.
*   **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, Circular. Operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and finding elements (e.g., middle element, detecting loops).
*   **Stacks and Queues:** LIFO and FIFO principles, common implementations (using arrays or linked lists).
*   **Trees (Basic):** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and basic traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
*   **Hashing:** `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `HashTable` â€“ how they work, collision resolution.
*   **Sorting Algorithms:** Understand the principles of common algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort (you might not need to implement them from scratch, but understand their time complexities).
*   **Searching Algorithms:** Linear Search, Binary Search.
*   **Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation):** Be able to analyze the complexity of simple algorithms.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Practice common coding challenges like string manipulation (palindrome, reverse string), array problems (finding min/max, duplicates), and basic recursion.

## IV. Frameworks (Spring Boot)

Spring Boot is widely used, so familiarity is often expected.

*   **Spring Boot Basics:**
    *   What is Spring Boot and its advantages (auto-configuration, embedded servers, simplified dependency management).
    *   Difference between Spring and Spring Boot.
    *   How Spring Initializr works.
*   **Annotations:** Understand common Spring Boot annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI) / Inversion of Control (IoC):** Explain these core Spring concepts.
*   **Spring Beans:** Lifecycle of a Spring Bean and different scopes (e.g., singleton).
*   **RESTful Web Services:**
    *   Understanding REST principles.
    *   HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    *   Status codes (200, 400, 404, 500, etc.).
    *   How to create a simple REST API using Spring Boot.
*   **Microservices (Basic Understanding):**
    *   What are microservices and their advantages/disadvantages compared to monolithic architecture.
    *   How microservices communicate (e.g., HTTP/REST).
    *   Basic concepts like Service Discovery, API Gateway, and Circuit Breaker pattern.

## V. Databases and SQL

Most Java applications interact with databases.

*   **SQL Fundamentals:**
    *   Basic DDL (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`) and DML (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) commands.
    *   `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.
    *   `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.
    *   `JOINs` (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`).
    *   `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.
*   **Database Concepts:**
    *   Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key.
    *   Normalization (basic understanding of 1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

### Tips for Preparation:

*   **Practice Coding:** Don't just memorize concepts; write code. Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or similar.
*   **Understand "Why":** For every concept, don't just know "what" it is, but also "why" it's used and "when" to use it.
*   **Review Your Projects:** Go through your past projects and be able to articulate the technologies used, challenges, and your contributions.
*   **Mock Interviews:** Practice explaining concepts and solving problems out loud.
*   **Ask Questions:** Prepare a few thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer at the end. This shows your engagement and interest.
